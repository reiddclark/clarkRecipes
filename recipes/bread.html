            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Warm milk, add butter, let cool, add 3 cups of white flour, salt and sugar, add 6 more cups flour, and eggs, dissolve yeast and add to mixture.  keep adding flour until right consistency, knead for 10 minutes.  let rest.  Pot in oiled bowl, cover and let raise double, punch down and turn over and let raise for 30 minutes, punch down, turn over,  let rest with lid off for 10 minutes.  Divide into 6 loaves, let rest 10 minutes.  Roll out and put into pans.  Raise till double.  Preheat oven 450*.  Put in bread and turn oven down to 325* and bake 35 min.<br><br>Personal method-  I use powdered milk and hot water.  I cook 1 cup oatmeal with 2 cups water in microwave.  When thick and cooked I place the margarine in container with oatmeal to melt margarine.  I place oatmeal, milk and margarine in bread mixer.  I then add the sugar, salt and some of the flour.  Then add the eggs and yeast.  I use instant yeast so there is no need to dissolve yeast in water, just add it directly to the bread mixture.  Add more flour (I like to use part whole wheat) until it is starts to pull away from the sides of the bosh bowl.  Let rest for 5-6 minutes.  Then start the bosh again, set timer for 10 minutes.  and add more flour until it is the right consistency.  Let knead for rest of 10 minutes.  Adding flour as needed.  When done kneading, put into an oiled bowl, cover.  Let rest until double in size.  Punch down and let rest for 30 more minutes.  Punch down, and separate into 6 loaves.  Depending on the dough I can sometime get 6 big loaves and 1 little loaf.  Let rest for 10 minutes and then roll up and put into pans.  Let raise until about 1 inch above the rim of pan.  Preheat oven to 450* place pans in and turn down oven to 325* and cook for 35 minutes.  Remove from pans, brush tops with butter.</p>
