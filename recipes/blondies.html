            <p>Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 13 by 9 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray. Fold two 16 inch pieces of foil or parchment paper lengthwise so that one measures 13 inches wide and the other measures 9 inches wide.  Fit one sheet in the bottome of the greased pan pushing it into the corners and up the sides of the pan. (the overhang will help in removal of the baked bars.) Fit the second sheet in the pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet.  Spray the sheets with nonstick cooking spray.  <br><br>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside.<br><br>Whisk the melted butter and brown sugar together in a medium bowl until combined.  Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well.  Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture until just combined.  Do not overmix.  Fold in the semisweet and white chocolate chips and th enuts and turn the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.<br><br>Bake until the top is shinny and cracked and feels firm to the touch, 22 to 25 minutes.  Cool completely on a wire rack.  Remove the bars from the pan using the foil or parchment handles and transfer to a cutting board.  Cut into 1 1/2 by 2 inch bars and serve.</p>
