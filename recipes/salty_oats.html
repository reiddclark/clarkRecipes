            <p>In large bowl beat butter a few minutes on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.  Scrape down sides of bowl and add sugars, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamo, beating until mixture is well blended.  Reduce speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla extract, mixing until well incorporated.  Reduce speed to low and add flour and oats, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary and mixing  just until they are incorporated.  Add chocolate chips, if using.Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill dough for at least an hour before baking.Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.Form dough into golf ball size balls and place about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet.  Sprinkle sea salt on top of each ball of dough.  Bake 1 sheet at a time 12-15 minutes or until cookies are puffed and beginning to turn golden, being careful not to overbake.  (The cookies should have a tender interior.)  Transfer cookies, still on parchment paper, to a wire rack to cool completely.We took a bar or dark chocolate and chopped it up to put into the cookies.  They were wonderful. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Per Serving (excluding unknown items): 344 Calories; 17g Fat (42.9% calories from fat); 4g Protein; 46g Carbohydrate; 1g Dietary Fiber; 83mg Cholesterol; 264mg Sodium.
