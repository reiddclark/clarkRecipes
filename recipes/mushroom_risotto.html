            <p>Have the stock at a simmer. Heat the oil in a heavy wide pan or soup pot. Add the onion and garlic an cook over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the barley and cook for 1 minutes, stirring to coat the grains. Raise the heat a little and the wine, and cook, stirring frequently until the wine is nearly absorbed. Add 2 1/2 cups of the stock, cover the pot and simmer until the stock is nearly absorbed.<br><br>Now start adding stock 1/2 cup at a time, stirring more or less constantly and waiting for each addition to be absorbed before adding more. After about 4 minutes the barley should be tender and the dish thick and creamy. You may not need to use the full amount of stock. Stir in the butter, cheese, half of the parsley and lemon juice to taste. Taste for salt and season with pepper. Serve garnished with the remaining parsley.<br><br>Heat a small skillet. Add the butter, as the foam begins to subside add the shallot. When it begins to look tender- 2 minutes, add the mushrooms, cook until the release the liquid- about 8 minutes. If they begin to stick and brown too much add a little bit of water, stock, white wine or whatever you choose to scrape the fond up and continue cooking. When mushrooms have finished cooking add the vinegar and turn off the heat. Taste for salt and pepper and garnish with thyme.</p>
