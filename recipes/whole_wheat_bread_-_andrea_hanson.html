            <ul>
                <li>7 c. whole wheat flour 2/3 c. vital wheat gluten 2 1/2, (120-130 F)2 T. salt2/3 c. oil2/3 c. honey or 1 c. sugar (I like</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Mix together the first three ingredients in your mixer with a dough hook. Add water all at once and mix for 1 minute; cover and let rest for 10 minutes (this is called sponging). Add salt, oil, honey or sugar, and lemon juice and beat for 1 minute. Add last flour, 1 cup at a time, beating between each cup. Beat for about 6-10 minutes until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. This makes very soft dough.<br> <br>Spray counter with pam and take dough out of the bowl. Do NOT flour your counter, this will add dryness you don’t want in the bread. You basically want your dough to feel a “little” sticky. Separate dough into bread pans, and let rise until double in size (usually about an hour). Bake at 350 for 22-30 ( I always just do 22) mins or until browned. This depends on your oven, just watch it a little and cover with foil if it looks like it’s getting brown too fast. <br> <br>This recipe will make 6 loaves of bread. I usually half the recipe, make 2 loaves of bread and one pizza dough for dinner that night. We have pizza once a week around here because it’s YUM and it kills 2 birds with one stone.<br> <br> <br>Bean Flour (Great Sub for cream of chicken, beef gravy, or cream of mushroom)<br>- 5 TBS of bean flour (use any white bean, and grind it - usually about 4 TBS of dry beans)- 1 3/4 cup water - 4 teaspoon of base (chicken, beef, mushrooms...whatever you want to try)<br>Mix it really well, then boil 3-5 minutes, and you have a great sub for cream of ___.
