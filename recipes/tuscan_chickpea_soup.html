            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt</li><li>6 tablespoons grated fresh Parmesan cheese, (this is about 1.5 ounces)</li><li>2 cups chopped onion, (I prefer purple onions)</li><li>8 nan garlic cloves, minced (I just used the canned minced)</li><li>4 cups water</li><li>1 teaspoon minced rosemary or 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li><li>3 nan (15.5 oz) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li><li>1 nan (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li><li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Heat 2 Tb of oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion brown until clear, then add the garlic and stir until both are brown. Don't burn the garlic! Stir in 4 c water, 1 ts rosemary, ¾ ts sea salt, ¼ pepper, 3 cans chickpeas (drained) and 1 can tomatoes (not drained). Bring all of it to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer for 20 minutes.<br>Take soup off heat. Puree the soup. I love my hand held Cuisinart mixer (which I got for my birthday from Sus! Thank you) which purees everything to a creamy texture in 3 minutes! You can also blend it by cupping half the soup in a blender, blending it, and then saving it in another bowl until it is all pureed.<br>Finally, bring all of the soup back into the pot. Stir in balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Place soup in bowls and garnish each bowl with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. YUM!</p>
