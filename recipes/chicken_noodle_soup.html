            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Fill pot with 1 quart water.   Wash and cut up chicken and onion.  Add to water, onion, 2 celery stalks, and 5 chicken bouillon.  Bring to a boil and then add cut up chicken.  Boil until chicken is done.   Remove chicken and let cool.<br><br>Strain broth and remove the chicken fat that has settled on top of broth.<br><br>Make more broth by adding more water and bouillon or by adding canned chicken broth or soup base.  I personally like the soup base.  Taste broth and add salt, pepper and extra soup base until it tastes right.  Have about 2 quarts broth total.  Bring to boil and add either homemade noodles, frozen or dry noodles.  Homemade and frozen are best, dry is last resort.  Add cut up chicken and cook until noodles are done.   Serve with hot homemade french bread.<br><br>When making final broth grated carrots and diced celery add extra flavor.   This is a family favorite especially on a cold day.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Per Serving (excluding unknown items): 422 Calories; 30g Fat (65.2% calories from fat); 33g Protein; 3g Carbohydrate; trace Dietary Fiber; 170mg Cholesterol; 1066mg Sodium.
