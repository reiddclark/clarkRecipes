            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups raw mixed nuts, (no roasting or salting)</li><li>2 t ground nutmeg</li><li>3 T ground cinnamon</li><li>1/8 cup Amaranth, (this is a whole grain)</li><li>1/4 cup Chia Seed</li><li>1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds, (no roasting or salting)</li><li>1/2 cup organic hemp seed, (doesn't have to be ground like flax seed for the body to use)</li><li>1 cup raw wheat germ</li><li>8 cups organic rolled oats, (not quick, that means they've been processed more)</li><li>1 cup organic raw shredded coconut, (this has NO sweeteners)</li><li>1/4 nan raw sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>1. Put all these ingredients in a small pot on the stove and warm them until the oil melts and they're all combined. It takes less than 5 minutes.<br><br>2. While your liquids are combining in a VERY large bowl combine:<br><br>3. Stir all your dry ingredients together in the bowl until well combined. If you have little kids like me, it's a good idea to "pulse" your mixed nuts in a food processor to make the pieces smaller and easier for them to chew.<br><br>4. Take the wet and pour small amounts over your granola mix and stir until well combined and moistened. Spread the granola equally on 2 jelly roll size pans (they are bigger than a 9x13 cookie sheet) and bake at 250 degrees for 45 minutes, stirring the granola around half way through the cooking time.<br><br>5. When your granola is cooked and cooled, I add dried UNSWEETENED fruits like raisins, cranberries, apples, bananas, dates, figs, cherries, papaya, pineapple, etc. Serve with milk, preferably Almond Milk!!</p>
