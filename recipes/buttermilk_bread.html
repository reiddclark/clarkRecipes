            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Makes two 8" x 4" loaves <br><br><br>This recipe is from The Laurel’s Kitchen Bread Book. The taste and texture are as close as you can get to “white bread” without giving up any of the nutrition of whole grain. The instructions below assume you are using a stand mixer. You can also prepare the dough with a breadmaker or by hand. <br><br>Place 5 ½ cups finely milled hard white wheat flour and 2 teaspoons instant yeast in bowl of mixer fitted with dough hooks. <br><br>In separate bowl, combine 1 ¼ cups buttermilk, ¾ cup hot water, ¼ cup honey, and 2 teaspoons salt. Whisk well to dissolve honey and salt. <br><br>Turn mixer on lowest setting and slowly pour in liquids. Knead with mixer for 10 - 12 minutes. Halfway through kneading, add 3 tablespoons of butter in small pieces. The dough will be somewhat sticky, but resist the temptation to add more flour, as adding flour will make your loaf tough and dense. <br><br>Turn dough into an ungreased bowl.  Let rise for an hour and a half or until doubled in bulk.<br><br>Gently turn risen dough onto table. Slowly press down on dough, letting air escape. Cut into two equal pieces. Sprinkle a LITTLE flour onto the table (a few tablespoons), and gently knead each piece of dough, forming each into a cylinder. <br><br>Place a dough cylinder into each greased bread pan. Put both bread pans back into the oven that is turned off. Let rise until pans are full and bread is just barely cresting the top of the pan. <br><br>Take pans out. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Return pans to oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until done. Turn bread out on cooling rack to cool completely. <br><br>You can also make rolls. Recipe will make 2 dozen rolls bake for 20 minutes at 400*.</p>
