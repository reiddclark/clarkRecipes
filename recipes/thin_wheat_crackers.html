            <ul>
                <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li><li>nan nan coarse, salt</li><li>nan nan scant, 1/2 cup</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Preheat oven to 325 F.<br><br>In a large bowl, combine the flours, sesame seeds, sugar and salt. Cut in the butter (use a pastry blender or two knives), then stir in the milk.  Add just enough milk to form a workable dough.<br><br>Divide the dough into three pieces, and roll out ultra thin, one piece at a time - 1/16 inch, if you can manage it (the thinner they are, the better; the thicker ones don't taste as good). Sprinkle with a bit of coarse salt if desired, and use the rolling pin to press the salt into the dough.</p>
