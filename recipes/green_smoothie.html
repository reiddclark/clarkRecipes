            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Any additional fruit you want as well.<br>Blend these ingredients for 30 more seconds and enjoy!!<br>A couple of additional tips...wash all your greens and fruits really well. You can also use frozen fruit like your bananas that have started to turn brown, just peel them and toss them in a freezer bag for smoothies later. The soaked/sprouted almonds should be soaked at least 24 hours but no longer than 48 hours; rinsing and changing their soaking water morning and night each day. They can then be stored in the fridge for about 4 days or dehydrate them (under 115) for 24hours and they keep longer.<br>Also an additional note on almonds. The almonds you buy commercially from a store may say "raw" but they have actually been pasteurized. The stores are required to sell pasteurized almonds due to a congressional law against selling raw foods. (thank you congress) so you need to seek out a source that actually purchases true "raw" almonds from the almond growers. Almonds are an amazing food and worth the effort to locate raw ones!!</p>
