            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>In large saucepan, bring water to a simmer; add chicken breast, onion and celery.  Bring water to a boil and gently boil chicken breasts in enough water to cover for 30 minutes.  Let chicken cool in broth and remove meat from bones.  Discard skin and bones; reserve broth for another use.Steam broccoli until just barely cooked and bright green.Preheat oven to 350Â°.  Make sauce by combining soup, mayonnaise, lemon juice and curry powder.In 9x13 casserole, place broccoli on bottom, then top with chicken or visa versa which ever you like.  Cover with sauce, then cheese, and bread crumbs.Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until bubbly. <br><br>Note:  Instead of using cream of chicken soup, you can make your own sauce.  Make a roux by melting 3 tablespoons butter and stirring in 2 tablespoons flour and cooking it 3 minutes until golden.  Then whisk in 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth seasoned with salt and pepper, cook over medium heat for 15 minutes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Per Serving (excluding unknown items): 3328 Calories; 276g Fat (71.5% calories from fat); 148g Protein; 100g Carbohydrate; 23g Dietary Fiber; 464mg Cholesterol; 4692mg Sodium.
