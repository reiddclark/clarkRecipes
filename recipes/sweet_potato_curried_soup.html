            <ul>
                <li>2 cups water</li><li>1 L coconut milk</li><li>nan nan a, few generously sized spoonfuls of Thai red curry</li><li>2 nan red bell peppers, diced</li><li>2 tbs. vegetable oil</li><li>8 medium sized sweet potatoes</li><li>2 nan stalks lemongrass, trimmed and cut into thirds</li><li>8 nan cloves garlic, minced</li><li>2 medium sized onions, diced</li><li>2 tsp. ginger, minced</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Preheat an oven to 190º C (375º F).  Place sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and roast for an hour or until soft.<br>    Remove sweet potatoes from oven and peel them (you may want to let them cool a little, they are hot – I just peeled them with my hands), then mash with a fork.<br>    In a large stockpot, heat oil on medium-high heat.  When hot, add in onions, garlic, lemongrass, and ginger, and let cook until fragrant and translucent.<br>    Add to the soup bell peppers, mushrooms, and curry paste and let cook about 5 more minutes, stirring every couple minutes to make sure everything is flavored well with the curry paste.<br>    Pour in the water, bring back to a simmer, then remove from heat.  Remove the lemongrass from the soup (but keep because we’ll be adding it back in later) and use the immersion blender to purée the soup in the pot.<br>    Add in the mashed sweet potato and coconut milk, and use the immersion blender to purée again the soup so that everything is smooth.<br>    Return the lemongrass to the soup and place the soup back on the stove – bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let cook at a low simmer for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors develop.<br>    Serve with a side of steamed sticky rice, or just enjoy plain in a bowl.  Enjoy!</p>
