            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup white grape juice</li><li>5 tablespoons butter</li><li>10 ounces spaghetti</li><li>3 cups coarsely chopped rotisserie chicken</li><li>1 cup cooked peas</li><li>2/3 cup freshly grated parmesean cheese</li><li>1/3 cup fresh bread crumbs</li><li>1/4 cup flour</li><li>2 cups chicken broth</li><li>1 3/4 cups milk</li><li>1/3 pound mushroom</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>In a large heavy saucepan cook the mushrooms in 1/4 cup of the butter over moderate hear, stirring, until most of the liquid they give off has evaporated, stir in the flour, and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add in a stream the milk, broth, and the white grape juice, stirring, bring the mixture to a boil,  simmer the sauce for 5 minutes.  In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it well.In a large bowl combine the spaghetti, mushroom sauce, chicken,  peas, and salt and pepper to taste, stir in 1/3 cup of the parmesan, and transfer the mixture to a buttered shallow 3-quart casserole.  In a small bowl combine the remaining  1/3 cup parmesan, the bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle the mixture evenly over the tetrazzine, and dot the top with the remaining1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits.  The tetrazzini may be prepared up to this point in advance and kept frozen, covered.  Bake the tetrazzini in the middle of a preheated 375Â° oven for 30-40 minutes, or until it is bubbling and the top is golden.  Tip - If you have a child that doesn't like mushrooms just take and blend the mushroom sauce so that they don't know that there are any mushrooms in the casserole.  The mushrooms add a much needed flavor to the tetrazzine.  This is also excellent made with rotisserie chicken.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Per Serving (excluding unknown items): 2266 Calories; 81g Fat (32.1% calories from fat); 77g Protein; 307g Carbohydrate; 19g Dietary Fiber; 213mg Cholesterol; 2815mg Sodium.
