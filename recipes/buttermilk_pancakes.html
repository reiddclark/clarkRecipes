            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1-2 teaspoons Vegetable oil</li><li>2 cups Buttermilk</li><li>3 tablespoons Butter, unsalted, melted</li><li>1 large Egg</li><li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon Baking soda</li><li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li><li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li><li>2 cups flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 200 degrees. Set a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet and set aside. <br><br>2. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, melted butter, and then the buttermilk. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into the well, and whisk very gently until the buttermilk mixture is just incorporated (a few lumps should remain). Be careful not to overmix the batter. <br><br>3. Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Brush the pan bottom with 1 teaspoon oil. Using 1/4 cup of batter per pancake, add the batter to the skillet (only 2 or 3 pancakes will fit at a time) and cook until large bubbles begin to appear, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until golden brown on the second side, about 1Â½ minutes longer. Spread the pancakes out over the wire rack on the baking sheet (they shouldn't overlap) and hold in the warm oven. Repeat with the remaining batter, brushing the skillet with oil as needed between batches.</p>
